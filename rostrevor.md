### Product Questions

1.  Work Experience  vs Relevant Work Experience.
      -  On Card/Table View , _"Work Experience"_ is used but on the other Expert Details Views we see _"Relevant Work Experience"_
      -  *Relevant Work Experience*  ===  *Work History* (all) ... how do we know it is relevant?
2.  Overview  ===  NM Bio + what else ?
3.  Tags shown by default yes?  Tags from streamliner?
4.  Project Expertise  ===  NM Highlights that is established in Streamliner ?
5.  Activity
      -  across CP per PROJECT for THAT expert (NM)  ?
      -  regardles of consultation/angle but includes all followups, angles that the NM is on on that PROJECT
      -  any scrub of Activites states? (added/invited/phone accept/payment requested and other internal states included?)

      -  is there a data or API for this already? ENG ü§ì ü§ì ‚ùì ‚ùì ‚ùì

6.  When View screeners is clicked on this card view/table view experts list page,  does the screener view slides out on this page or is the user redirected to the
   expert details view?  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c139800-8e87-4b63-bd3e-160dafdb8841)

7.  "**CEO at ABC Company** has indicated the following:  "  
     If the project is scheduled or completed (and not BLINDED) do we replace _CEO at ABC Company_  with the NM's Name

8.  `Matrix Completed` what does this mean and what is the alternative wording if not completed?   When clicked what is the expected behaviour.


9.  I will get back to you on the `check box` type questions and your design ideas on these. Here the NM can choose multiple options and the response can be long
